Title: OpenAI-compatible AI Gateway on Cloudflare Workers (OpenRouter + Neon + PostHog)\n2. 5-minute Quick Start (TL;DR)\n   - Clone + install (bun), .dev.vars template, wrangler dev, health check\n3. Environment & Configuration\n   - .dev.vars with OPENROUTER_API_KEY, POSTHOG_*, ALLOWED_ORIGINS, DEFAULT_MODEL, NEON_DATABASE_URL\n   - wrangler.toml: bindings (KV CACHE, D1 DB optional), flags (nodejs_compat), routes for staging/prod\n4. Agent-ready Snippets (TL;DR blocks)\n   - OpenRouter client (OpenAI-compatible baseURL) with streaming\n   - Tool-calling example\n   - Request correlation (request_id, X-Reference-Id) and logging envelope\n   - Usage logging: D1 variant and Neon variant with @neondatabase/serverless\n   - PostHog LLM events with privacy toggle\n   - Rate limiting middleware using KV\n5. Architecture Overview\n   - Runtime, edges, data flow (client -> Worker -> OpenRouter -> logs -> PostHog -> metrics)\n6. Implementation Details\n   - API endpoints (chat completions), middlewares (auth, rate limiter, security, CORS), error handling\n   - OpenRouter integration hardening: model list fetch with auth; fallbacks and retries; consistent headers\n7. Database Options\n   - D1 (edge-local) vs Neon (serverless Postgres). Provide pros/cons and recommend Neon for analytics and D1 for low-latency cache if both used\n   - Provide schema(s) for usage_logs, api_keys (missing), and optional rate_limits if DB-based approach chosen\n8. Security & Compliance\n   - API key hashing scheme, rotation, scopes; CORS allowlist; structured errors; privacy defaults\n9. Testing Strategy\n   - Vitest unit, Miniflare integration, k6 load; provide runnable examples\n10. Deployment & CI/CD\n   - Wrangler deploy, secrets, environments; optional Neon migrations in CI\n11. Troubleshooting\n   - OpenRouter errors, CORS, rate limits, Neon connectivity, Workers limits; wrangler tail tips\n12. Additional Resources\n\nDetailed Change List (actionable)\nQuick Start + Environment\n- Replace existing Quick Start with a 5-minute path using Bun commands and a single copy block for:\n  - cloning, install, creating .dev.vars, running `bun run dev` or `wrangler dev`, and a curl health check\n- Provide a concise .dev.vars template that includes:\n  - OPENROUTER_API_KEY, POSTHOG_API_KEY, POSTHOG_HOST, ALLOWED_ORIGINS, DEFAULT_MODEL, MAX_TOKENS_DEFAULT, RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE\n  - NEON_DATABASE_URL (new) and a flag DB_PROVIDER=d1|neon (new)\n- Add notes for macOS Sequoia 15.5 and Bun\n\nOpenRouter hardening\n- Standardize on the OpenAI-compatible baseURL=`https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` with headers including Authorization, HTTP-Referer, X-Title, and an optional X-Reference-Id per request\n- Provide two examples:\n  1) Direct fetch streaming SSE to the client (already present; refine)\n  2) AI SDK 5 Chat Completions using baseURL + model selection + streaming\n- Include robust error normalization into OpenAI-compatible error shapes\n\nModel selection & fallbacks\n- Keep the model tier map; ensure model listing is fetched with auth; add caching guidance in KV for 5 minutes\n- Add budget fallback and retry with exponential backoff; log failures to PostHog with a non-PII payload\n\nPostHog LLM observability\n- Provide a minimal capture snippet that works on Workers (either REST ingestion via fetch or using nodejs_compat), with a privacy toggle that strips $ai_input/$ai_output and only forwards lengths and token counts by default\n- Standardize properties: request_id, user_id, model, input_tokens, output_tokens, cost, latency_ms, provider: \"openrouter\", privacy_mode: boolean\n\nDatabase (D1 and Neon)\n- Add missing api_keys schema (id, key_hash, user_id, permissions, rate_limit, is_active, last_used_at)\n- Provide D1 migration commands (already referenced) and add Neon schema and connect snippet via @neondatabase/serverless (edge driver)\n- Recommend: Use KV for rate limiter and DB (D1/Neon) for billing-grade audit logs\n\nSecurity & Rate limiting\n- Complete the securityHeaders middleware example and list headers (CSP, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.) with defaults safe for API\n- Unify rate limiting doc to KV-based sliding window or fixed window, and remove/confine DB rate_limits table to the optional advanced path\n- Add CORS guidance for local (http://localhost:4321 for Astro, http://localhost:3000 if used) and production domains\n\nTesting\n- Add runnable Vitest unit test for selectModel and error normalization\n- Add Miniflare integration test for the chat endpoint with streaming\n- Add a small k6 script for sustained RPS to validate rate limits\n\nDeployment & CI/CD\n- Provide wrangler deploy steps for staging/prod; include secret setup for OPENROUTER_API_KEY, POSTHOG_API_KEY, NEON_DATABASE_URL\n- Provide a GitHub Actions example that runs tests, Miniflare, deploys to staging on main, to production on tagged release; include optional Neon migration step\n\nTroubleshooting\n- Expand sections to include: CORS preflight failures, OpenRouter 401/429, Neon connection issues (timeouts, SSL), Workers execution limits, wrangler tail usage patterns\n\nAgent-ready TL;DR snippets (new, early and duplicated at end)\n- Streaming chat completion via OpenRouter (fetch) with SSE piping\n- AI SDK 5 example with baseURL pointing to OpenRouter\n- Tool-calling: function schema, function call, and callback pattern in Worker\n- Usage logging (D1 and Neon versions)\n- PostHog capture minimal + privacy mode\n- KV-backed rate limiter middleware wiring (auth -> rateLimiter -> handler)\n\nConsistency Fixes Identified\n- Rate limiting: pick one primary mechanism (KV) and present DB table as optional advanced scenario\n- Add missing api_keys schema to align with auth middleware\n- Ensure all examples use the same DEFAULT_MODEL and header structure\n- Clarify D1 vs Neon recommendation and show both snippets side-by-side\n- Ensure PostHog usage is Workers-compatible and privacy-first by default\n\nAcceptance Criteria (to validate after edits)\n- Quick Start: A developer can set up and get a streaming response in under 5 minutes using a single copy block on macOS + Bun\n- Environment: .dev.vars template includes OpenRouter, PostHog, Neon; wrangler.toml examples include KV and optional D1; secrets documented clearly\n- OpenRouter: Examples compile and run on Workers; headers consistent; streaming and fallbacks work; model list fetch authenticated; optional correlation header\n- Database: D1 and Neon options both documented with runnable insert snippet for usage_logs; api_keys schema present and consistent\n- PostHog: Copy-paste snippet works in Workers with nodejs_compat or REST; privacy toggle documented and safe-by-default\n- Security & Rate limiting: Middleware examples complete; KV rate limiter works; CORS and security headers documented with safe defaults\n- Testing: Vitest + Miniflare + k6 examples provided and runnable\n- Deployment & CI: Clear steps for staging/prod; sample GitHub Actions provided\n- Troubleshooting: Covers common failure modes with actionable fixes\n- TL;DR: Agent-ready snippets block enables fast execution without reading the entire doc\n\nAssumptions\n- Monorepo uses Bun, Cloudflare Workers, Hono, and TypeScript strict\n- nodejs_compat is acceptable for PostHog SDK; if not, fallback to REST is provided\n- Neon integration is optional but recommended for analytics-grade persistence\n"
