### Technology Stack

- **Runtime**: Cloudflare Workers (V8 isolates)
- **Framework**: Hono.js for HTTP routing
- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite-compatible)
- **Caching**: Cloudflare KV storage
- **AI Integration**: AI SDK 5 with OpenRouter provider
- **Analytics**: PostHog with LLM observability
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict mode
- **Package Manager**: Bun for dependency management

### Data Flow

1. Client sends authenticated request to `/v1/chat/completions`
2. Authentication middleware validates API key against D1 database
3. Rate limiting middleware checks usage quotas using KV storage
4. Request validation ensures OpenAI compatibility
5. AI SDK routes request to appropriate OpenRouter model
6. Response streaming begins immediately for real-time user experience
7. PostHog captures analytics events asynchronously
8. Response caching stores deterministic results in KV storage

## Estimates & QA Checklist

### Implementation Estimate

**Story Points**: 34 points  
**T-shirt Size**: Large (L)  
**Justification**: This is a comprehensive implementation requiring multiple
integrations (OpenRouter, PostHog, Cloudflare services), security hardening,
performance optimization, and extensive testing. The complexity spans
authentication systems, real-time streaming, analytics integration, and
production-grade monitoring.

**Timeline**: 12-16 weeks with 2-4 developers  
**Justification**: Timeline accounts for iterative development, comprehensive
testing, security reviews, and production deployment with proper validation
phases.

### QA Checklist

#### Functional Testing

- [ ] **Authentication**: API keys validate correctly and reject invalid tokens
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Requests are properly throttled and return 429 status
      when exceeded
- [ ] **Chat Completions**: Endpoint returns OpenAI-compatible responses
- [ ] **Streaming**: Real-time responses work without data loss or interruption
- [ ] **Model Selection**: Intelligent routing and fallback mechanisms function
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and error messages returned
- [ ] **Input Validation**: Malicious inputs are rejected with appropriate
      errors

#### Performance Testing

- [ ] **Response Time**: P95 response time under 200ms for cached requests
- [ ] **Throughput**: System handles 1000+ concurrent requests
- [ ] **Cache Performance**: Cache hit rate exceeds 60% for deterministic
      requests
- [ ] **Database Performance**: Query response times under 50ms P95
- [ ] **Memory Usage**: Worker memory consumption within Cloudflare limits

#### Security Testing

- [ ] **OWASP Compliance**: Security headers pass automated scanning
- [ ] **Input Sanitization**: SQL injection and XSS attempts blocked
- [ ] **API Key Security**: Keys are properly hashed and stored securely
- [ ] **HTTPS Enforcement**: All endpoints require encrypted connections
- [ ] **Secrets Management**: No credentials exposed in logs or responses

#### Integration Testing

- [ ] **OpenRouter Integration**: Successfully routes requests to LLM providers
- [ ] **PostHog Analytics**: Events are captured and processed correctly
- [ ] **Database Operations**: CRUD operations work reliably
- [ ] **Cache Operations**: KV storage read/write operations function
- [ ] **External Dependencies**: Graceful handling of service outages

#### Operational Testing

- [ ] **Health Checks**: Endpoint accurately reports system status
- [ ] **Monitoring**: All metrics are captured and displayed correctly
- [ ] **Alerting**: Notifications trigger within 60 seconds of issues
- [ ] **Backup/Recovery**: Database backups complete and restore successfully
- [ ] **Deployment**: CI/CD pipeline deploys without manual intervention

## Risks & Mitigations

### 1. OpenRouter API Changes or Service Outages

**Impact**: High - Complete service unavailability  
**Probability**: Medium - Third-party dependency risk  
**Mitigation Strategy**:

- Implement multiple LLM provider fallbacks (Anthropic direct, OpenAI direct)
- Deploy circuit breaker patterns with automatic failover
- Establish SLA monitoring with real-time alerting
- Maintain provider relationship for advance notice of changes

### 2. Rate Limiting Bypass and DDoS Attacks

**Impact**: High - Service degradation and unexpected costs  
**Probability**: Medium - Common attack vector for APIs  
**Mitigation Strategy**:

- Implement multi-layer rate limiting (IP, API key, user-based)
- Deploy Cloudflare DDoS protection with automatic scaling
- Configure cost-based circuit breakers to prevent runaway expenses
- Establish monitoring for unusual traffic patterns

### 3. Performance Degradation Under High Load

**Impact**: Medium - User experience degradation  
**Probability**: Medium - Scaling challenges common in edge computing  
**Mitigation Strategy**:

- Conduct comprehensive load testing with realistic traffic patterns
- Implement auto-scaling with Cloudflare Workers
- Deploy intelligent caching strategies to reduce backend load
- Establish performance monitoring with automated alerting

### 4. Security Vulnerabilities in Dependencies

**Impact**: High - Potential data breach or service compromise  
**Probability**: Low - Well-maintained dependencies with security focus  
**Mitigation Strategy**:

- Implement automated dependency scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Establish regular security audit schedule
- Maintain rapid patching procedures for critical vulnerabilities
- Deploy comprehensive input validation and sanitization

### 5. Cost Overruns from Unexpected Usage Patterns

**Impact**: Medium - Budget impact and potential service suspension  
**Probability**: Medium - Difficult to predict usage patterns accurately  
**Mitigation Strategy**:

- Implement real-time usage monitoring with budget alerts
- Deploy automatic quota enforcement and graceful degradation
- Establish cost-per-request tracking with trend analysis
- Create emergency cost controls and service throttling

## Critical Constraints and Assumptions

### Constraints Followed

- **Document Structure**: Implemented standardized PRD/RFC template with all
  required sections
- **Content Preservation**: Maintained all original technical content while
  enhancing structure
- **Professional Language**: Converted to formal, active-voice documentation
  suitable for enterprise stakeholders
- **DevOps Integration**: Added comprehensive CI/CD workflows, folder structure,
  and automation artifacts
- **Monorepo Considerations**: Included specific folder layout, code ownership,
  and build isolation strategies
- **Implementation Estimates**: Provided story points, T-shirt sizing, and
  detailed effort justification
- **Risk Management**: Created formal risk register with impact assessment and
  mitigation strategies

### Assumptions Made

- **Enterprise Requirements**: Assumed enterprise-grade security and compliance
  needs based on comprehensive monitoring and security specifications
- **Single-Tenant Implementation**: Inferred from API key structure and lack of
  multi-tenant organization features
- **Team Experience**: Timeline estimates assume moderate experience with
  Cloudflare Workers and TypeScript
- **Budget Allocation**: Cost optimization features suggest significant usage
  volume and budget considerations
- **Compliance Requirements**: GDPR/CCPA compliance assumed based on PostHog
  privacy features and data handling specifications
- **Production Scale**: Performance targets (1000+ concurrent requests, 99.9%
  uptime) indicate production-scale deployment expectations
