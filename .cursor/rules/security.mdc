# Security Guidelines

## ðŸ”’ Security

1.  **Server-Side Authority:** Keep sensitive logic, validation, and data manipulation strictly on the server-side (Cloudflare Worker backend, `dist/_worker.js/`). Use secure API endpoints defined in the worker.
3.  **Dependency Awareness:** Be mindful of the security implications of adding or updating dependencies listed in [package.json](mdc:package.json). Utilize `bun audit` or GitHub Dependabot alerts.
4.  **Credentials:** Never hardcode secrets or credentials in the codebase. Use environment variables managed via `.dev.vars` (local, see [.dev.vars.example](mdc:.dev.vars.example)) and Cloudflare Worker Secrets configured in [wrangler.jsonc](mdc:wrangler.jsonc) for deployments.
6.  **Authorization:** Implement authorization checks in the backend worker after successful authentication to ensure users can only access appropriate resources/actions.
